# Celeste-Mechanics-In-Godot

A little Godot thing where I (TRY TO) recreate some stuff from Celeste

Created using Godot and GIMP.

Currently implemented:

- The death "Explosion" from Celeste (Placeholder sprites, will add better later)
- "Smooth" camera transitions (Automatic) between levels (Horizontal and one way only, for now. Will add vertical and both way support later)
- Climbing (Kinda, very buggy)

Need to do:

- Wall Jumping
- Dashing
- Something to collect (?)
